        <p class="falcon1"> Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the worldâ€™s first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows
            SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access. <br><br> Falcon 9 can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms (50,300 lb) to low Earth orbit (LEO), 8,300 kg (18,300 lb) to geostationary
            transfer orbit (GTO) when expended, and 5,500 kg (12,100 lb) to GTO when the first stage is recovered.<br><br> The heaviest GTO payloads flown have been Intelsat 35e with 6,761 kg (14,905 lb), and Telstar 19V with 7,075 kg (15,598 lb). <br><br>            In December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months, with a plan to double the rate to one every six weeks. By September 2013, SpaceX's total manufacturing space had increased
            to nearly 93,000 square metres (1,000,000 sq ft), and the factory had been configured to achieve a maximum production rate of 40 rocket cores per year.

        <h1 class="launch">Launch History</h1>
        <p class="lauchtxt"> Rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 112 times over 11 years, resulting in 110 full mission successes (98%), one partial success (SpaceX CRS-1 delivered its cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), but a secondary payload
            was stranded in a lower-than-planned orbit), and one failure (the SpaceX CRS-7 spacecraft was lost in flight). Additionally, one rocket and its payload Amos-6 were destroyed before launch in preparation for an on-pad static fire test. <br>            The first rocket version Falcon 9 v1.0 was launched five times from June 2010 to March 2013, its successor Falcon 9 v1.1 15 times from September 2013 to January 2016, and the latest upgrade Falcon 9 Full Thrust 89 times from December 2015
            to present, 41 of which using a re-flown first stage booster.<br><br> Falcon Heavy was launched once in February 2018, incorporating two refurbished first stages as side boosters, and then again in April and June 2019, the June 2019 flight
            reusing the side booster from the previous flight. <br><br> The final "Block 4" booster to be produced was flown in April 2018, and the first Block 5 version in May 2018. While Block 4 boosters were only flown twice and required several months
            of refurbishment, Block 5 versions are designed to sustain 10 flights with just inspections.</p>
