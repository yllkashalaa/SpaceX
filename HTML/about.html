                    <h3 class="quicktxt"> QUICK FACT ABOUS SPACEX:
                        <p> 1. What Has SpaceX Done That Other Companies Haven’t? <br> - SpaceX scored its first big headline in 2010, when it became the first private company to launch a payload into orbit and return it to Earth intact—something only government
                            agencies like NASA or Russia’s Roscosmos had done before. Its upright landing and recovery of the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket on Dec. 21 2015, was another first. Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, sent
                            a rocket to the edge of space and landed it upright earlier this year, but it was a demonstration flight and did not achieve orbit.
                            <br>
                            <br> 2. What Are Musk’s Ultimate Goals? <br> -Becoming the Apple of the rocket business is one way of looking at it, though Musk demurs on that analogy without demurring on the idea of assuming a similarly dominant role in
                            the space sector. His biggest, dreamiest target is sending people to Mars—which does not make him unusual unless he can actually achieve it. He boasts that he could fly human passengers there for as little as $500,000 per seat,
                            but in this case he may be over-promising. The laws of economics might be even harder to overcome than the laws of physics, and neither has been cracked sufficiently yet to make a Mars mission achievable. As for whether Musk
                            himself would go? “I would to go to space, but I have to forgo that,” he told TIME in 2012, citing his five sons and multiple companies. “I have to be careful with personal risks.”
                            <br>
                            <br> 3. SpaceX's first rocket: Falcon 1 <br> - Musk was already an experienced businessman when he started SpaceX, and he strongly believed that more-frequent and more-reliable launches would bring down the cost of exploration.
                            So, he sought out a stable customer that could fund the early development of a rocket: NASA. (Later, he wooed launch clients from various sectors to diversify his customer base.) As such, his goal for SpaceX was to develop
                            the first privately built, liquid-fueled booster to make it into orbit, which he called the Falcon 1.
                            <br>
                            <br> 4. It’s helping inspire more astronaut dreams. <br> - Fostering the next generation of astronauts means making sure today’s students are excited about science and math. SpaceX may have helped do that this week when it
                            included experiments contributed by 15 American students in Dragon’s payload. Students began creating the experiments in June 2010, and 779 teams made up of students from grades 5 to 12 submitted proposals.
